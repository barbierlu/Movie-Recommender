# Movie Recommender
**Author: Luke Barbier**

## Summary
This program will analyze data provided from MovieLens.com. The free public data contains over 2 million ratings from over 137,000 users. A graph will be created where each movie is a node, connected to other nodes with the edges being the users (their ID's) who rated both movies and their numerical ratings of the movies. The program will be able to recommend movies given a user of the program's interests. When a user of the program specifies their favorite movie, the program will find that movie in the graph and search the edges for the adjacent node with the highest average rating. It will therefore be able to recommend movies based on the fact that people have preferences for genres and similarities between movies. The program may reach capability to improve recommendations by a user entering more than one movie. It could do this by searching for the highest rated common adjacent node between the movies. For quick access to a movie in the graph a separate RB Tree will organize movie node locations by title.
